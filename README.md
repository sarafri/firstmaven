# firstmaven

This is a learning project but also can be handy for maven projects. 
There is a pom example where you can find:
 * How to make 'mvn exec:java' run the code
 * Make clean a default phase which has to be run before compile. (So it will be done before every phase running.)

Besides that experiences: put '/idea' in .gitignore.
